# Device Verification Feedback & ToDo List

## Issues Identified
- [ ] **Image Restoration Bug**: When restoring data (Firebase), images (profile, events) are not restored. Existing remote data might be getting overwritten with empty local data.
- [ ] **Wording Change**: In the Pro version registration/info, change "複数の子供登録" to "複数のお子様登録" (or similar polite phrasing).
- [ ] **Missing Legal Text**: Terms of Service (利用規約) and Privacy Policy (プライバシーポリシー) are currently empty. Need to fill with appropriate placeholder/template text.
利用規約やプライバシーポリシーは日本語で記述すること
- [ ] **Missing Contact Feature**: "Contact Us
" (お問い合わせ) functionality is missing. Needs to launch the mail app (`mailto:`) with a specific address.
